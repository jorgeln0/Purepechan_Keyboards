Justification:
* Adapted from (Spain) Spanish keyboard since the Purépechan alphabet uses Latin letters and several Purépechan speakers also speak Spanish
* For simplicity and bilingual usage, we did not assign dual latin alphabet letters in Purépechan to a unique key. Instead users will have to sequentially press each key.
* For special characters and letters using aspirated apostrophes, we developed a new state of the keyboard when pushing the "Option/Alt" key. This provides a shortcut to letters that use aspirated apostrophes and special characters in Purépechan.
* Aspirated apostrophe was added to the keyboard for any user to mannual alter their letters.
* A few characters were lost (e.g. ß, ˆ, and †) and the caret symbol (^) was reassigned to ALT M.
OPTION + c = chʼ
OPTION + i = ï
OPTION + k = kʼ
OPTION + p = pʼ
OPTION + t = tʼ
OPTION + s = tsʼ
OPTION + ` = ʼ
ALT + m = ^
